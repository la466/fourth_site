free2bind a suite of general purpose bioinformatics tools for computing the 
minimum free energy (the most stable) binding between two separate RNA 
molecules.

Detailed information about how to use these tools can be obtained
by running the tool with the '-h' parameter.  For example:

shell> ./free_align.pl -h

will give all sorts of details of what the input is expected to be as well
as what you might expect as the output.
