Changes made after 1.0:

* free_scan now converts the rRNA sequence into RNA (if it is input as
  DNA, with 't' instead of 'u').


Changes made after 0.9:

* Added additional documentation to free_scan and free_align about how
  different options can cause doublets to be scored differently.

* modified "extract_indices.pl" to ignore genes that have "vague" annotation.
  That is to say, it ignores genes that contain '<' or '>' characters in
  their location annotation.

* free_scan now prints out the value for $gNumBases, if defined, as a comment
  ($gNumBases is number of bases specified by the -n option, the total 
   number of bases you want to analyze).

* Modified "extract_seq" so that it will wrap around if it needs to.  This
  assumes that a sequence is circular.

* Modified the '-c' option so that the names of the genes (comments in 
  index_data) get printed at the tops of columns.

* Added a '-r' option for free_scan so that it can print out the output
  with one row of data per row in index_data.

* The comments printed by "free_scan", which include the first base in the
  alignment (binding) and the position, have been modified.  The "position"
  is now negative for all leader bases, incrementing the closer it gets to the 
  start index, zero for the start index position and positive for all bases
  after.  For example, if the length of the leader was 3, then the numbering
  of the bases would be: -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 etc....

* Tightened up the documentation a little bit.  Tried to remove references to
  a "command_file" and, instead, add references to "index_data", in order to 
  differentiate between what these programs will accept and what you can pass
  to Rosnick's old "calc_free_energy" program.


Changes made after 0.8:

* free_scan.pl now prints out header information if you pass in a path for
  each file.

* Fixed a bug in the extract_seq() that was causing the -n option in 
  extract_seq.pl and free_scan.pl to not work with genes with multiple exons.

* The XIA_MATHEWS parameters are now the default.  (instead of the freier ones)

* Added more details to the output of free_align and free_scan.  
  Parameter values for loops are specified, since they may be from a different
  source as the parameter values for doublet binding.

* Added a means to penalize dangling ends (bulges on the ends of alignments).  
  This is needed in order to be able to completely eliminate bulges from
  alignments.  The "-b 0" option only prevented internal bulges.  


Changes made after 0.7:

* changed the switches for "leader" and "trailer" to "L" and "T" (from "l" and
  "t".)  This allows for consistency between extract_seq.pl and free_scan.pl.

* removed all "window" options.  Replaced them with "-n" for num_bases.
  See inline documentation in extract_seq.pl for details.

* removed the "-f" option documentation from free_scan.pl.

* added some options (trailer, window) to free_scan.pl, as well as a
  path argument that can direct where the output goes.

* fixed a bug in the output when the -f option is used in free_align.pl.

* extract_seq.pl now allows for command data (index data) to be specified on
  the command line.

* extract_indices.pl now has a "-r" (for "relaxed") option that picks up genes 
  even if they are not experimentally verified and are lacking the "/gene="
  field.  It seems that genes without the "/gene=" field have a "/locus_tag=" 
  tag instead.

* modified free_align.pl and FreeAlign.pm so that when using the '-f' option 
  and "force_bind()" you can print out the alignment.

* extract_indices.pl now has three options: Gene, CDS or mRNA.


Changes made after 0.6:

* Updated TUTORIAL and the "help" information for free_scan.pl

* Added to the "header" data that both free_align.pl and free_scan.pl
  the parameters as well as the temperature.

* Modified free_align.pl and free_scan.pl so that you can set the binding
  temperature.

* Modified free_scan.pl so that you can now take advantage of the ability
  to select different parameter values to simulate binding between two 
  strands of nucleotides.

* Modified extract_seq.pl and free_scan.pl so that the command_file is now
  an optional command line argument.  If command_file is not specified, then
  all of the sequence from the sequence file is extracted/examined.

* Changed the name of "extract_dna.pl" to "extract_seq.pl" to reflect the
  general nature of the tool (it can extract any kind of sequence data from
  a FASTA file.  DNA is just one of the many types...)

* force_bind(), in FreeAlign.pm now scores the start and end of the helix as
  "terminal doublets" regardless of where in the sequence the helix begins.
  (formerly, terminal doublets were scored only if they occurred at the very
   ends of the sequence.  Helices that did not include the very ends of the
   sequence did not have "terminal doublets").

* Modified free_align.pl so that you can now take advantage of the ability
  to select different parameter values to simulate binding between two
  strands of nucleotides.

* Modified FreeAlign.pm so that you can select different parameter values for
  the binding of internal doublets.  Currently the choices are SantaLucia 
  (1998) and Freier (1986).


Changes made after 0.5:

* replaced both cds2cmd.pl and mrna2cmd.pl with extract_indices.pl

* extract_dna.pl, the '-w' feature now returns window_size*2+1 bases.  That
  is to say, window_size bases before and window size bases after, plus the one
  for the base that defines the start position.

* cds2cmd.pl: since we are no longer attempting to maintain compatibility with
  David Rosnick's program "calc_free_energy", command files now look more like
  the syntax you actually see in genbank files.  "join" and "complement" as
  well as their associated parentheses are allowed in command files now and
  this program was modified (simplified) to allow for that change.

* extract_dna.pl will now accept "join(start..stop,start..stop,etc.)" syntax
  as well as "complement(join(stop..start,stop..start,etc.))" syntax.

* extract_dna.pl will now accept command files that contain 
  "complement(stop..start)" syntax and do the right thing.

* Fixed a bug in extract_dna.pl that was causing the -w option to ignore the
  fact that sometimes the start index is larger than the stop index and in 
  this case the sequence should be complemented and reversed.  Now it works
  fine.

* The "output as fasta", or "-f" option for extract_dna.pl now puts a lot
  more information in the comment line.

* fixed a bug in way output from free_align.pl was formatted.  The "pairs"
  string was not lining up correctly with the actual alignment when the
  binding in both strands started on the same index > 1.

* added -o option for free_align.pl - this is a lot like the -f option, only
  the helix does not have to begin with the first bases in both sequences.

* free_scan.pl now only allows for the "forced alignment".  The '-f' option
  is still there, but will eventually be removed since the results are the
  same regardless of its use.

* free_scan.pl no longer creates a temporary file named "temp_cmd" in order
  to extract sequence data.  Instead it uses the "tmpnam" command to create
  a new filename, this file is the opened (if it does not already exist) and
  used for the command data.  After it has served its purpose, it is deleted.

* mrna2cmd.pl was added to the package.


Changes made after 0.4:

* free_align.pl now has a "force" option that allows for an alignment between
  two strands of RNA to be force to begin with the first bases in both strands.
  Only bases that can form a helix are scored (free energy wise) and both
  loops and bulges are ignored.

* free_scan.pl now has the same "force" option that free_align.pl has.

* extract_dna.pl now has an option so that its output can be in FASTA format.

* free_align.pl will now accept strings or files (in FASTA format) or mixtures
  of the two.

* fixed a minor problem with extract_dna.pl (blank lines in the command file
  were causing blank lines to occur in the output) that spilled over into
  errors being reported by free_scan and free_align.


Changes made after 0.3:

* made a lot of changes to how free_scan.pl prints its output.  It will also
  now allow you to add some leader sequence to each line in the command file.

* added the ability to turn on/off bulges and loops


Changes made after 0.2:

* added the "-e" (Energy Only) option to restrict the output to just the
  energy value (Delta-G)

* fixed bulges, and thus, the transition to published penalties for bulges
  is now complete.

* fixed loops, and thus, the transition to published penalties for loops is
  now complete.
  
* fixed a bug with blunt ends to helices on the right-hand side and loops.

* added to the output of free_align.pl.  New statistics include:
    a) start positions of the binding in both sequences
    b) length of binding
  also added an explanation of the "pairs" characters.
