We provide two different scripts that verify table 4 genome ratios calculated in the manuscript.

script1

Command 1: chmod a+x 4thsite.tcl
Command 2: ./4thsite.tcl
Output: results4thsite.xls

The input file (Mesoplasma_florum_l1.ASM830v1.cds.all.fa) needs to be run in the same directory as the script.


script2

Command: python3 fourth_site.py
Output: results_fourth_site.csv

This will calculate properties of the table 4 genomes located in the test_genomes folder. AE017263.txt contains the extracted coding sequences for the M. florum genome.
